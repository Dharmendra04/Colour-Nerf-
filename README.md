The Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) is revolutionizing computer graphics with its ability to synthesize photorealistic imagery from sparse data. By using artificial neural networks to represent 3D scenes, the NeRF generates stunningly realistic visuals that rival real-world photography. It reconstructs immersive environments from just a few images or viewpoints, bridging the gap between the physical and digital realms. The NeRF is advancing research in computer vision, computer graphics, and augmented reality, with applications in object recognition, scene understanding, and data visualization. As this technology continues to evolve, it promises to unlock new creative possibilities and transform various industries.

# This Repository

This repository contains a NeRF model which used Spherical Harmonics to get the final RGB colour from a novel neural architecture (Which is inspired by Plenoctree [See here](https://alexyu.net/plenoctrees/) but different from their approaches). Additionally I learned about neural radiance field from the following course ([NerF Course Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/neural-radiance-fields-nerf/)) and highly reccommend this course for new learners.
